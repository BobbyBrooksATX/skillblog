                  Since my presentation about two weeks ago, I have been working on incorporating some of the suggestions and performing additional robustness tests. The updated version of the slides can be found here.
A recap of the key results - I find a positive correlation between the foreign-born and consumption shares within U.S. counties but this result does not hold across Asian countries. In fact, an increase in foreign-born share led to a decline in consumption of Asian-related consumer packaged goods.

                  In the previous post, I provided an exploratory analysis of the allrecipe dataset. This post is a continuation and details the construction of product weights from the recipe corpus.
TF-IDFTo obtain a measure of how unique a particular word is to given recipe category, I calculate each word-region score using the TF-IDF approach which is given by the following formula:
\[TF\text{-}IDF_{t,d} =\frac{f_{t,d}}{\sum_{t&#39;\in d}f_{t&#39;,d}} \cdot log \frac{N}{n_{t}+1}\] where \(f_{t,d}\) is the frequency in which a term, \(t\), appears in document \(d\), \(N\) is the total number of documents in the corpus and \(n_{t}\) is the total number of documents where term \(t\) is found.

                  One of the main component of my thesis is a mapping from consumers’ purchases to country related expenditure shares. This requires a method to associate each available product to a particular country. I have briefly discussed the issue in the introductory post but have made significant progress on this front that I think is worth sharing.
The recipe datasetThis recipe dataset was created by scraping recipes from allrecipes.com that are tagged to particular region or country.

                  This week’s Thesis Thursday will be a two part special, partly to make up for last week’s missing post. I also want to take the opportunity to document some thoughts and progress. This post is arguably the more technical of the two and focuses on issues relating to the model and methodology of my paper. In the subsequent post I plan to document some analysis on the recipe dataset which I think is very interesting (maybe even more so then the actual thesis itself).

                  I was trying to find an R package that provides features similar to Stata’s binscatter user written program but there does not appear to be any good substitutes around. Hence, I decided to write a function that replicates it in R. Turns out it actually took longer than I thought and there are still many bugs to fix but the developmental version is worth sharing. It can be downloaded from my Github page.

                  Over the past week I made a few detours and explored other options that yielded little. On the positive side, I managed to merge and clean most of the datasets and started generating some descriptive statistics to get a better understanding of the data.
Migration to the U.S. Let us take a look at U.S. migration patterns from 1970 to 2012.1 I use the share of foreign born as surveyed in the decennial census and American Community Survey as a proxy for migration trends.

                  I decided to document my progress on my masters thesis as a weekly Thursday special. Hopefully I would have enough materials or progress to continue the weekly post but this should also give me some motivation to work on it. I find the process of writing also useful to think through some ideas more carefully. This week I will be introducing the idea of my research project, the data I will be using and some issues I am trying to solve.

                  I have been trying to catch-up on the latest release of Singapore’s economic results. Unfortunately, the official press release or media reports are not very useful. They either contain too much irrelevant information or not enough details for my liking. Maybe I just like looking at the numbers and letting the figures speak for themselves. Hence, I decided to obtain the data from the official SingStat’s Table Builder website.

                  And so it ends with ivregress 2sls y (x=z),
the last line of my do file reads.
Competition promotes efficiency, maximises welfare,
the official doctrine proclaims.
So took the chance I did.
Hyperplanes, Hamiltonians and more contrived jargon,
the beauty of the abstractness.
Yet the triviality of it all.
He who roll the dice should be prepared to pay its price,
the lesson from the probability gods.
But at least it is unbiased?

                  I have been toying with the idea of starting up a new blog for quite a while but school has kept me occupied and the plans were constantly pushed back. Last year, I explored the possibility of using a wordpress system but it just seems too much of a trouble to incorporate all the features I wanted. The recently introduced blogdown R package, which this website is built on, seems like a perfect solution.
