      <description>I have been working quite a bit with Python recently, using the popular Jupyter Notebook interface. Have been thinking about uploading some of my machine learning experiments and notes on the blog but integrating python with a blog built on blogdown seems problematic as I could not google a solution. Turns out it is actually quite simple (maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why nobody posted a tutorial on it, or maybe people who blog in R do not really use Python).</description>
