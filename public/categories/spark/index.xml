      <description>Introduction Lately, I have been using PySpark in my data processing and modeling pipeline. While Spark is great for most data processing needs, the machine learning component is slightly lacking. Coming from R and Python&amp;rsquo;s scikit-learn where there are so many machine learning packages available, this limitation is frustrating. Having said that, there are ongoing efforts to improve the machine learning library so hopefully there would be more functionalities in the future.</description>
