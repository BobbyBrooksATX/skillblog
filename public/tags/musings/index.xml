      <description>Sorry about the lack of post over the past few month. Hope to regain some work life balance and update the blog more regularly. To start of the first blog post of 2018 I thought it would be nice to do share some interesting things that I have been reading over the past few weeks and create a to-do list to function as my commitment device.
Fun FactsDid you know that the skin color of a cat is heavily determined by a gene located on the X chromosome?</description>

      <description>A collection of thoughts to start the month off.
On the blog - Had a look at the google analytics data. There are about 750 views in total since the blog’s inception with a few users clocking in 5-10 minutes per post - so thank you for bumping up the stats if you are a regular reader!
The most popular post…is the SG dashboard. This was a little surprisingly. I thought my thesis or any of the mathy stuff is more interesting but who knows?</description>
