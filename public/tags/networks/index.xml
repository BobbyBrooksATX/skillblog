      <description>While waiting for the winds of winter to arrive, there is plenty of time to revisit the 5 books. One of my favourite aspects of the series is the character and world building. As the song of ice and fire universe is so big, many characters are mentioned in passing while the major characters meet each other only occasionally. I thought it would be interesting to see how various characters are connected and how that progresses through the series.</description>
