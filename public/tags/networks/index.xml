      <description>This is the second post of a character network analysis of George R. R. Martinâ€™s A Song Of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) series as well as my first submission to the R Bloggers community. A warm welcome to all readers out there! In my first post, I touched on the Tidygraph package to manipulate dataframes and ggraph for network visualisation as well as some tricks to fix the position of nodes when ploting multiple graphs containing the same node set and labeling based on polar coordinates.</description>

      <description>While waiting for the winds of winter to arrive, there is plenty of time to revisit the 5 books. One of my favourite aspects of the series is the character and world building. As the song of ice and fire universe is so big, many characters are mentioned in passing while the major characters meet each other only occasionally. I thought it would be interesting to see how various characters are connected and how that progresses through the series.</description>
