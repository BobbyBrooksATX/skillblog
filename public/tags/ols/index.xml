      <description>This post is the first in a series of my study notes on regression techniques. I first learnt about regression as a way of fitting a line through a series of points. Invoke some assumptions and one obtains the relationship between two variables. Simpleâ€¦or so I thought. Through the course of my study, I developed a deeper appreciation of its nuances which I hope to elucidate in these set of notes.</description>
