Finally, the last installment of the Thesis Thursday series! Rather than going through what I have done since the previous post (basically more refinements and robustness checks), I decide to take this time to reflect on what I have learnt over the past few months. The completed [research paper](/files/mig_cons_paper.pdf) and [accompanying slides](/mig_cons_slides/) can be downloaded from my website.
