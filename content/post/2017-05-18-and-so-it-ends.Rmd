And so it ends with `ivregress 2sls y (x=z)`,   
the last line of my do file reads.  

Competition promotes efficiency, maximises welfare,  
the official doctrine proclaims.  
So took the chance I did.  

Hyperplanes, Hamiltonians and more contrived jargon,  
the beauty of the abstractness.  
Yet the triviality of it all.  

He who roll the dice should be prepared to pay its price,  
the lesson from the probability gods.  
But at least it is unbiased?  

Thus it was, that in the march of time,  
the mirage evaporates,  
and marks the end.
