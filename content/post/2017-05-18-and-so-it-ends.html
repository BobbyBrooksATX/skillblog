<p>And so it ends with <code>ivregress 2sls y (x=z)</code>, the last line of my do file reads.</p>
<p>Competition promotes efficiency, maximises welfare, the official doctrine proclaims. So took the chance I did.</p>
<p>Hyperplanes, Hamiltonians and more contrived jargon, the beauty of the abstractness. Yet the triviality of it all.</p>
<p>He who roll the dice should pay its price, the lesson from the probability gods. But at least it is unbiased?</p>
<p>The mirage evaporates in the march of time, and so it ends at the start.</p>
