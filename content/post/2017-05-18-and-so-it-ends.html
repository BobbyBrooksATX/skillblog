<p>And so it ends with <code>ivregress 2sls y (x=z)</code>,<br />
the last line of my do file reads.</p>
<p>Competition promotes efficiency, maximises welfare,<br />
the official doctrine proclaims.<br />
So took the chance I did.</p>
<p>Hyperplanes, Hamiltonians and more contrived jargon,<br />
the beauty of the abstractness.<br />
Yet the triviality of it all.</p>
<p>He who roll the dice should be prepared to pay its price,<br />
the lesson from the probability gods.<br />
But at least it is unbiased?</p>
<p>Thus it was, that in the march of time,<br />
the mirage evaporates,<br />
and marks the end.</p>
