<p>Cross-posting from my companyâ€™s blog, but if you have not checked it out, I wrote an <a href="https://www.cylynx.io/blog/efficient-large-graph-label-propagation-algorithm">interesting technical piece on how we engineered a large scale label propagation algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>The accompanying slides can be found <a href="https://www.timlrx.com/large-graph-analytics/index.html">here</a></p>
