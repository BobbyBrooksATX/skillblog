<p>The <a href="https://timlrx.github.io/dashboard/sg-dashboard/">SG-Dashboard</a> has been updated with the 2Q 2017 figures. I also took the opportunity to add in a few new tables and charts. There is a new table that keeps track of value-added (VA) revisions of last quarter’s result. VA for certain industries such as construction are approximated based on early indicators and the actual figures normally takes a quarter or more to stream in. It is also interesting to see the actual economic performance and whether it matches up to the narrative of last quarter’s release.</p>
<p>In addition, there are three new graphs on employment in Singapore. My figures are slightly different from the official estimates and are approximated from the productivity and GDP series. This gives an average employment figure rather than the official end of period employment. For the third graph featuring change in employment since 2010, the change in employment for the most recent year are year to date changes. The accumulated bars give a good picture on how the labour market has changed since 2010.</p>
