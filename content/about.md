Welcome to Quasilinear Musings! I am Timothy, a Masters student in the Vancouver School of Economics and my research interest revolves around technological change, labour markets and econometrics. For more information check out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-lin-0600ba141/). 

I plan to use this blog to document ongoing projects and play around with new ideas. The blog also allows me to share some of my works in a more accessible manner and explore the use of data to communicate ideas. Some of the projects I am working on include my masters thesis ([slides available here](/mig_cons_slides/)), a dashboard on the [Singapore economy](/dashboard/) and a series of notes on regression analysis.

This blog was written in R markdown using the excellent [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package that is a wrapper for Hugo (a static site generator). Source code for the website is available at my [Github page](https://github.com/timlrx/website-hugo).
