Welcome to Quasilinear Musings! I am currently a Masters student in the Vancouver School of Economics and my research interest revolves around technological change, labour markets and econometrics. You can find more information about me at my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-lin-0600ba141/). 

I plan to use this blog to document ongoing projects and share some thoughts on data analytics. The blog also provides a nice platform to share some of my works in a more accessible manner and explore the use of data to communicate ideas. This blog was developed using [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), an excellent R package that provides a wrapper for Hugo (a static site generator) and synthesizes well with the R markdown scripts. Source code is available at my [Github page](https://github.com/timlrx/timlrx.github.io).

Upcoming blog plans: 

- Convert and compile my hard-copy statistics and econometric notes to an online version
- Share some thoughts on the Singapore economy
- Document my current masters research project
- Experiment with some cool data visualisation and presentation techniques
- Rant about causal inference
